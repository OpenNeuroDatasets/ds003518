Simon conflict task with cost of conflict reinforcement manipulation.   Study 1: 80 healthy participants (2 removed) + 5 placebo session from a pilot of the drug study.  Total n=83.  Study 2: 30 healthy participants (3 dropout) in a double-blind drug study.    Total n=27.   Drug was Cabergoline 1.25 mg.   Study 1 subjects had IDs 101-180 and the 5 placebo were 301/401 - 305/405.   Study 2 subjects had IDs 305/405 - 330/430.   The dual numbers were for session:  300s were first session, 400s were second session.  Here we have simply put them in as session 1 and session 2.   So Joe Smith would have been 305 on visit 1, then 405 on visit 2.  If he got cab first we indicated that in the Sess1_Drug column.   EEG published here: 10.1038/ncomms6394.   Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected circa 2012-2013 in Laboratory for Neural Computation & Cognition at Brown.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data.   Triggers are complicated.  See CC_Triggers.mat under code folder.  A few old analysis scripts are included.  - James F Cavanagh 02/15/2021
